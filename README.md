## Workflow

- A branch gets automatically created in the repo for each new issue created
- The issue gets closed automatically when the related branch is merged in main

To start working on an issue:
`git fetch`
`git checkout {branch}`

When the job is done:
`git add .`
`git commit -m "message"`
`git push`

Create a PR on the repository to merge in main branch
